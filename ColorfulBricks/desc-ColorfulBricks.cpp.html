EXAMPLES

0)
"ABAB"

Returns: 2

There are six possible ways to arrange all the bricks into a row: "AABB", "ABAB", "ABBA", "BAAB", "BABA" and "BBAA". Out of these, only "AABB" and "BBAA" have at most one pair of adjacent bricks with different colors.

1)
"AAA"

Returns: 1

In this test case, all bricks have the same color. Hence, there is only one way to arrange them into a row. That row is nice, because it has no adjacent bricks of different colors.

2)
"WXYZ"

Returns: 0

Since all four bricks are of different colors, the bricks at positions 0 and 1 will have different colors. Similarly, the bricks at positions 1 and 2 will also have different colors. Hence, no matter how the bricks are arranged in a row, the row will not be nice.
